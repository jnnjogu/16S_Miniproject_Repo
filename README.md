## About this project

The aim of the project is to reproduce the workflow used by the authors of the paper. Here is the link to the paper [click here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7692941/)
Briefly the study involves characterization of the Kenyan Honey Bee gut microbiota. The authors characterized the honey bee gut microbiota in sub-Saharan Africa using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. They confirmed the presence of the core gut microbiota members and highlight different compositions of these communities across regions and found that bees from the coastal regions harbor a higher relative abundance and diversity on core members. They also showed that Gilliamella, Snodgrassella, and Frischella dominate in all locations, and that altitude and humidity affect Gilliamella abundance in contrast, they found that Lactobacillus was less common compared temperate regions of the world.

16S rRNA was amplified and sequenced using paired end reads on a MiSeq instrument. They analyzed 2,117,668 reads and we will be documenting the 16S rRNA Gut community analysis workflow.
